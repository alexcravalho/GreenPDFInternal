# GreenPDFInternal

Welcome, everyone! This is an application I am currently working on for a small landscaping company specializing in commercial bark blowing. Since the company is small they use lots of paper forms for their records. The company wants to move into the digital age, help the environment and save on costs.

This application uses various packages to navigate to my neatly designed web form I made in React, capture it as a PDF, then send it off to a specified email address, which can be filed by the company's cloud storage system.

I used TypeScript and React on the front-end, then Node and Express with JavaScript on the back-end.

**Disclaimer: I've excluded the company's logos to protect their privacy.
